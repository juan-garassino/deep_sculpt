# DeepSculpt

## What this project is
A 3D generative art system that learns to create sculptures from scratch.
It uses two types of AI models:
- A **GAN** (two networks fighting each other — one creates shapes, one judges them)
- A **Diffusion model** (gradually removes noise to reveal a shape, like developing a photo)

The sculptures are stored as 3D grids of numbers (numpy arrays):
- Monochrome shapes: a cube of numbers, each cell says "empty" (0) or "solid" (1)
- Color shapes: same cube but each cell also has a color encoded as 4 numbers (RGBA)

## What I'm trying to do
Train the AI to generate believable 3D shapes it has never seen before,
then navigate the "space" of all possible shapes it has learned — finding
new sculptures, blending between two shapes, or asking "show me something rounder".

## The pipeline (in order)
1. **Generate training data** — create thousands of example 3D shapes using math
2. **Validate the data** — make sure the shapes look right before training
3. **Train the GAN or diffusion model** on those shapes
4. **Evaluate** — check if the AI is learning or getting stuck
5. **Explore** — navigate the space of shapes the AI has learned

## Stack
- Python, NumPy, PyTorch
- Shapes stored as `.npy` files
- Training runs on GPU (CUDA)

## Skills available to help
- `ds-datagen` — help writing shape generation code
- `ds-dataval` — help writing data checking and visualization code
- `ds-gan` — help with GAN architecture and training code
- `ds-diffusion` — help with diffusion model code
- `ds-latent` — help with latent space navigation code
- `ds-improve` — autonomous agent that runs improvement loops on the codebase

## ⚡ AGENT BEHAVIOR — READ THIS FIRST

When the user says anything like:
- "this isn't working" / "it's broken" / "fix this"
- "the training is getting worse"
- "the shapes all look the same"
- "make it better" / "help me improve this"
- "something is wrong"

**Do NOT just give advice. Immediately launch the `ds-improve` agent.**
Run it autonomously: measure diversity and validity of generated shapes,
diagnose what's failing, apply targeted fixes to the code, and report
what changed.

When the user says anything like:
- "explain how X works"
- "I don't understand X"
- "what is X"

Use the skills interactively to explain — don't launch the agent.

When the user says anything like:
- "write the training loop"
- "help me build the generator"
- "implement X"

Use the relevant skill interactively to write the code together.

## How to ask (no jargon needed)
- "The shapes all look the same" → launches ds-improve (mode collapse)
- "Training is crashing" → launches ds-improve
- "Something looks wrong with the data" → launches ds-improve
- "Blend between two sculptures" → interactive, uses ds-latent
- "Explain what a GAN is" → interactive explanation
- "Write the shape generator" → interactive, uses ds-datagen

## Current status
[ Fill in: what's working, what's broken, what you're trying to build next ]

## File structure
[ Fill in once you have files: e.g. "train.py runs training, models/ has the networks" ]
